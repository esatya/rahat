# Code of Conduct

We are a community of contributors - developers, volunteers, researchers, and humanitarian agencies from all over the world. We create an environment where our community can effectively explore, create innovative and open aid distribution technology services that are inclusive, accountable, and accessible for everyone. 

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Rahat to all the contributors. 

For a detailed code of conduct,  please see our [Rahat:Code of Conduct](https://docs.rahat.io/docs/next/code-of-conduct/).
